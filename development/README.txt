#DIRECTORY FOR ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

#The directories "reciprocal" and "zeropot" contain the subroutines and 
#corresponding modified main code that attempt to add periodic boundary 
#conditions to the UQ method.

#The directory "entropy" contains only a subroutine capable of calculating
#the entropy associated with the random sampling in code.

#The directory "input_test_files" contains ke.txt and pos.txt inputs 
#at two different temperatures to test UQ code for accuracy. 

#The validity of the UQ code is determined by comparing statistics 
#of total electronic energy calculated by UQ code
#to corresponding outputs generated by Quantum ESPRESSO (QE).
